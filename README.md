# Nightwatch Boilerplate

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm i
```

## Run tests

```bash
npm t
```

## Adding Selenium

Just rename the file named `nightwatch-with-selenium.json` at the root of the project to `nightwatch.json` replacing the current one, if selenium is not needed it's fine to delete it.
